## Differences From Thesis Site

Quite a few differences.

- 1 class, not many classes.

- Book Readings, these are like assignments, but not entirely. Want to allow students to both see the entire conversation, threaded properly, as well as individual posts. As such, should allow for @-mentions and no comments. A general "discussion app" I guess.

- No Markdown. These are just first years, be easy dog.
